        a new play by Jack Thorne, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is the eighth story in the \
        Harry Potter series and the first official Harry Potter story to be presented on stage. \
        The play will receive its world premiere in London’s West End on July 30, 2016. \
        It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn’t much easier now that he is \
        an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children. \
        While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus \
        must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, \
        both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places."

        with Holland's dying body through the rift--back into Black London. Now, restless after having \
        given up his smuggling habit, Kell is visited by dreams of ominous magical events, waking only \
        to think of Lila, who disappeared from the docks as she always meant to do. As Red London finalizes \
        preparations for the Element Games--an extravagant international competition of magic meant to \
        entertain and keep healthy the ties between neighboring countries--a certain pirate ship draws \
        closer, carrying old friends back into port. And while Red London is caught up in the pageantry \
        and thrills of the Games, another London is coming back to life. After all, a shadow that was gone \

        evil, lust, betrayal, forgiveness and the redemptive power of love. When the immortal race of the \
        Fae destroyed the ancient wall dividing the worlds of Man and Faery, the very fabric of the universe \
        was damaged and now Earth is vanishing bit by bit. Only the long-lost Song of Making—a haunting, \

        mythic Song—Mac, Barrons, Ryodan and Jada—must contend with old wounds and new enemies, passions \
        that burn hot and hunger for vengeance that runs deep. The challenges are many: The Keltar at war \
        with nine immortals who’ve secretly ruled Dublin for eons, Mac and Jada hunted by the masses, the \
        Seelie queen nowhere to be found, and the most powerful Unseelie prince in all creation determined \

        into the town library and borrows books for all his forest friends. It will pub in spring 2017. \
        Liza Voges at Eden Street represented the author; the illustrator was unagented. Bunny, a rabbit, \
        has been eavesdropping on the local library’s outdoor story time and fallen in love with how books \
        can spark an array of adventures: “As he listened, Bunny imagined himself climbing mountains... \
        captaining a ship... ruling a kingdom.” But now that it’s sweater weather, and story time has moved \
        indoors, what will Bunny do? The answer isn’t exactly legal (book return slots are intended for books, \
        after all) and it gets a little out of hand (pretty soon Bunny’s friends all want in on his after-hours \
        library excursions). But the librarian turns out to be forgiving where these trans-species bibliophiles \
        are concerned, and since “All libraries have rules,” Bunny and his accomplices end up with their own \
        library cards. Debut author Silvestro can sometimes be too literal and earnest (“He followed his nose \
        to the adventure section”), but she makes the pleasures of reading abundantly clear. Mai-Wyss (The Passover \
        Lamb) smartly divides the storytelling into small, telling moments, amplifying each vignette with a fine eye \
